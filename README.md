## 📊 Project Highlights

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Merged multiple datasets for consistent Olympic data.
- Handled missing values and inconsistent country names.
- Created additional features like **Gold/Silver/Bronze ratios**, **total medals**, and **year of first participation**.

### 🔹 Overall Analysis
- Timeline of Olympic Games: frequency, locations, and growth.
- Total number of nations and events over time.
- Year-over-year comparison of overall athlete participation.

### 🔹 Country-Wise Analysis
- Top-performing nations based on total medals.
- Medal trends across different Olympic editions.
- Country performance heatmaps by sport and year.

### 🔹 Sport & Event-Based Analysis
- Dominant nations per sport.
- Athlete counts per sport, over time.
- Gender balance in events across different years.

### 🔹 Athlete Insights
- Most decorated athletes (gold count, total medals).
- Age distribution of athletes by sport and medal category.
- Participation trends by age group and gender.

### 🔹 Interactive Dashboards (if using Streamlit)
- Filters by country, year, sport, gender, and medal type.
- Dynamic charts and plots for a more engaging experience.
